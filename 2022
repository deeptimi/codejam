# Problem # PUNCHED CARDS
A secret team of programmers is plotting to disrupt the programming language landscape and bring punched cards back by introducing a new language called Punched Card Python that lets people code in Python using punched cards!
Like good disrupters, they are going to launch a viral campaign to promote their new language before even having the design for a prototype.
For the campaign, they want to draw punched cards of different sizes in ASCII art.
